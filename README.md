Data Structure &amp; Algorithm Code SPPU 2019

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in C++. Below is an overview of the tasks completed in this project.

### 1. Searching and Sorting
- **Bubble Sort:** Sorting students based on roll numbers in ascending order.
- **Insertion Sort:** Sorting students alphabetically by name.
- **Quick Sort:** Finding the first ten toppers from a class.
- **SGPA Search:** Searching students according to SGPA and printing students with the same SGPA.
- **Binary Search:** Searching students by name using binary search.

### 2. Stack
- **Singly Linked List Implementation:** Implementing a stack using a singly linked list.
- **Expression Conversion:** Converting infix expressions to postfix and prefix.
- **Expression Evaluation:** Evaluating postfix and prefix expressions.

### 3. Circular Queue
- **Array Implementation:** Implementing a circular queue using an array.
- **Operations:** Supporting insertion (enqueue), deletion (dequeue), and display operations.

### 4. Expression Tree
- **Tree Construction:** Constructing Expression Trees from postfix and prefix expressions.
- **Traversals:** Implementing recursive and non-recursive in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals.

### 5. Binary Search Tree
- **Binary Search Tree Implementation:** Implementing a binary search tree.
- **Operations:** Supporting insertion, deletion, search, tree traversal, finding depth, mirror image, creating a copy, displaying parent nodes with child nodes, displaying leaf nodes, and displaying the tree level-wise.

### 6. Threaded Binary Tree
- **Threaded Binary Tree Implementation:** Implementing an In-order Threaded Binary Tree.
- **Traversals:** Traversing the tree in In-order and Pre-order.

### 7. Graph: Minimum Spanning Tree
- **Graph Representation:** Representing the college campus graph using adjacency list/matrix.
- **Minimum Spanning Tree:** Finding the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal’s and Prim’s algorithms.

### 8. Graph: Shortest Path Algorithm
- **Graph Representation:** Representing the city graph using adjacency matrix/list.
- **Shortest Path:** Finding the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm from a single source to all destinations.

### 9. Heap Sort
- **Heap Sort:** Sorting a given set of values using max or min heap.

### 10. File Handling
- **Sequential File:** Creating a sequential file to store and maintain student data.
- **Operations:** Supporting addition, deletion, and display of student information from the file.
